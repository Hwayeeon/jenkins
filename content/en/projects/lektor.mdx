## Business View

### Project Overview
Lektor is a web platform I built to digitize community fundraising by transforming manual ordering workflows into a seamless, automated online ordering ecosystem. The project is designed to help church communities and small-scale food sellers generate revenue more efficiently by connecting sellers directly with local visitors who can order online.

### The Challenge
Before Lektor, fundraising orders were handled manually — via phone or face-to-face — which caused:

- Time-consuming and error-prone processes
- Difficult to track or manage orders
- Limited customer reach and visibility

The core issue was _how to transform an offline, disorganized workflow into a trusted, scalable online experience without complex infrastructure_.

### My Solution
I designed and built a lightweight web ordering platform where:
- Sellers upload _product listings_ with prices and images
- Visitors can _browse and order instantly_ in an easy-to-use flow
- Orders automatically sync to Google Sheets, collecting:
  - Customer name
  - Phone number
  - Selected items
  - Total sales

This setup eliminates manual data entry while maintaining centralized, exportable data.

### Impact & Results
This project wasn't just a functional upgrade — it created measurable business value:

- **Sales performance increased significantly**
- Communities saw **revenue growth of up to 30%+** after implementing Lektor
- Process efficiency improved with automated tracking and reduced errors

Lektor proves how thoughtful web automation can transform local fundraising efforts into scalable revenue channels.

## Developer View

### Technical Overview
Lektor is a full-stack web application that demonstrates modern web development practices, integrating multiple technologies to create a complete e-commerce solution for fundraising.

### Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, mobile-first design
- **Backend**: API routes for order processing and validation
- **Database/Storage**: Google Sheets API integration for real-time data synchronization
- **Deployment**: Vercel for automatic CI/CD and edge network distribution

### Key Technical Challenges

#### 1. Google Sheets Integration
Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and Google Sheets API v4 to enable:
- Real-time order synchronization without database infrastructure
- Automatic data validation and formatting
- Error handling for API rate limits and network failures

#### 2. Order Management System
Built a robust order processing pipeline:
- Client-side form validation with Zod schemas
- Server-side data sanitization and verification
- Transaction-like behavior ensuring data consistency
- Automatic timestamp and order ID generation

#### 3. Performance Optimization
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for product catalogs
- Debounced search and filtering
- Client-side caching for improved UX

#### 4. Responsive Design
Achieved mobile-first, fully responsive interface:
- Breakpoint system for various screen sizes
- Touch-optimized controls for mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement strategy

### Code Quality & Best Practices
- TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Environment variable management for configuration
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### Scalability Considerations
While Google Sheets serves as the data layer for MVP, the architecture is designed with modularity in mind:
- Abstracted data access layer for easy migration to traditional databases
- API-first design allowing future mobile app integration
- Stateless server design for horizontal scaling

This project showcases not just the ability to ship features, but to architect maintainable, scalable solutions while balancing technical constraints with business needs.
