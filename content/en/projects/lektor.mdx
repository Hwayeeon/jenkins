## Business View

### Project Overview
Lektor is a web platform designed to modernize community fundraising by turning manual ordering workflows into a seamless online experience. It allows church communities and small-scale food sellers to sell products digitally while tracking sales automatically, making fundraising faster, more accurate, and more profitable.

### The Challenge
Before Lektor:

- Orders were managed manually via phone or in-person.
- Tracking payments and orders was error-prone and slow.
- Customer reach and visibility were limited.

The main problem: how to create a scalable, trustworthy online ordering system without complex infrastructure.

### The Solution
I built a lightweight, intuitive web platform where:

- Sellers upload product listings with images and prices.
- Customers browse items, add them to the cart, and checkout without creating an account.
- Orders are automatically sent to Google Sheets for real-time tracking of:
  - Customer name & phone number
  - Selected items & quantities
  - Total sales
  - Payment status

This setup eliminates manual entry while keeping all data centralized and exportable.

### Impact & Results

- Revenue increased by 30%+ for communities using Lektor.
- Fundraising became more efficient with automated tracking and reduced errors.
- Both the person in charge (PIC) and buyers found the system easy and convenient.

> Summary: Lektor demonstrates how a small but well-architected web app can turn offline fundraising into a scalable, automated, and profitable system, making life easier for both sellers and buyers.

## Developer View

### Technical Overview
Lektor is a full-stack web application built with modern technologies, demonstrating scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web development practices.

### Architecture & Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (React) for server-side rendering and responsive UI
- Styling: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first design
- Backend: API routes for order validation and processing
- Data Storage: Google Sheets API v4 for real-time order tracking
- Deployment: Vercel for CI/CD and global edge network

### Key Technical Challenges

#### 1. Google Sheets Integration
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and Sheets API v4
- Enabled real-time order sync without a traditional database
- Added automatic data validation, formatting, and error handling

#### 2. Order Management System
- Client-side form validation with Zod schemas
- Server-side data sanitization and verification
- Generated unique order IDs and timestamps
- Ensured transaction-like behavior for consistency

#### 3. Performance Optimization
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Lazy-loaded product catalogs
- Debounced search and filtering
- Client-side caching for faster UX

#### 4. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first layout and touch-friendly controls
- Breakpoints for multiple screen sizes
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

#### 5. Code Quality & Best Practices
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Environment variables for configuration
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### Scalability Considerations
- Modular data layer for easy migration to a traditional database
- API-first design allows future mobile app integration
- Stateless server design for horizontal scaling

### User flow
- User visits the website
- No login required
- Select items → Add to cart → Checkout
- Auto direct message to PIC
- Order recorded in Google Sheets → Transaction complete
