## Business View

### Project Overview
davidsonrafael.online is my personal website designed to introduce who I am, what I build, and how I solve real-world problems using technology.
The platform serves as a centralized portfolio that showcases my projects while clearly explaining the challenges behind them and the solutions I delivered.

This website goes beyond visual presentation — it demonstrates my ability to analyze problems and create modern, efficient, and automated digital solutions.

### The Challenge
Before this website existed:

- My work and projects were spread across multiple platforms.
- There was no single place that clearly explained the problem, solution, and impact of my work.
- It was difficult for others to understand my role, decision-making process, and technical contributions.

Main Problem: How to present my personal profile and projects in a professional, structured way that communicates real-world problem solving — not just code or design.

### The Solution
I built davidsonrafael.online as a personal platform where:
Visitors can learn about my background, skills, and experience.

Each project is documented with a clear structure:
- The real-world problem
- The challenges faced
- The solution designed and implemented
- The website focuses on clarity, usability, and performance.
- Content is structured for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Impact & Results

- My work is now presented in a clear and professional format.
- Projects are easier to understand because they show context, not just outcomes.
- The website strengthens my personal brand as a developer who delivers practical and impactful solutions.

> Summary: davidsonrafael.online is a personal platform that represents my journey, skills, and real-world problem-solving mindset through modern web technology.
